**A project-based guide to building web apps with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#**

## What is this book about?
Blazor WebAssembly makes it possible to run C# code on the browser without having to use JavaScript, and does not rely on plugins or add-ons. The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is to work with a browser that supports WebAssembly which, as of today, all modern browsers do

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web development
* Use the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly application
* Use templated components and the Razor class library to build a modal dialog box
* Understand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssembly
* Build a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speed
